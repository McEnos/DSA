             * In some programming languages, including Java, integer overflow can occur when dealing with large numbers.
             * When calculating the midpoint in a binary search, a common formula is (low + high) / 2.
             * However, if low and high are large enough, their sum could exceed the maximum value an integer can store, causing overflow.
             * Java uses 32-bit signed integers, which have a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
             * If low and high are both close to this maximum value, their sum could wrap around to a negative number due to overflow. For example:
             * int low = 2_000_000_000;
             * int high = 2_000_000_000;
             * int mid = (low + high) / 2; This will overflow and produce a negative result
             * To prevent overflow, the midpoint is calculated using the formula low + (high - low) / 2 instead of (low + high) / 2.
             * This approach ensures that we are only adding a value that cannot cause overflow:
             * <p>
             *
             * Using low + (high - low) / 2 instead of (low + high) / 2 prevents integer overflow by
             * ensuring that the intermediate sum does not exceed the maximum value an integer can hold.
